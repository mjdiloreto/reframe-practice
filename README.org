* Re-frame practice
Using [[https://github.com/day8/re-frame][re-frame]] to create basic Single-Page Applications.

** What are my goals
1. Practice developing with Emacs
   1. [[https://docs.cider.mx/cider/index.html][Cider]] for tooling, debug, repl
   2. [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] for version control
   3. [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] for documentation
2. Practice Clojure/script
   1. Learn [[https://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] tooling
3. Develop proficiency with re-frame
   1. <<target>> Quickly spin up basic SPAs to interact with Clojure applications
   2. Internalize functional approach to building web applications
   3. Compare with developing applications with React/Redux
4. Document the process
   1. So that I don't forget
   2. To maybe organize some sort of tutorial

* To create a new project.
1. lein new re-frame <project-name>
2. In a separate terminal run: lein do dev
   1. This will create the shadow-cljs.edn file necessary for cider to work correctly.
   2. I do not like this step. It should just work, but I haven't been able to do it another way.
   3. This is a consequence of using "lein new re-frame" which references "re-frame-template" on Github.
   4. You can interrupt the process once it compiles the app.
3. In Emacs: cider-jack-in-cljs (C-c M-J)
4. when prompted for command: shadow-cljs
5. when prompted for REPL type: shadow
6. when prompted for build: :app (should be in a dropdown already, if you have to type it won't work.)
7. when prompted to open in browser: y
8. Results:
   1. (, s s) in emacs opens the repl connected to the browser
      1. (js/alert "hello") will prompt inside the browser
   2. (, e e) will evaluate code in the current buffer in the repl, and effects will immediately happen in the browser
   3. *Saving any file will cause changes in the browser WITHOUT changing app state.*
      
* Lessons learned.
1. This process (using "lein new re-frame") requires quite a bit of setup for a small app.
2. Re-frame seems very well suited to larger apps, e.g. [[https://github.com/jacekschae/conduit][this awesome "real-world" app]].
3. Because one of my goals was [[target]], I will change approach and use basic [[https://reagent-project.github.io/][reagent]] for this purpose.
