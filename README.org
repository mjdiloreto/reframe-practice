* Re-frame practice
Using [[https://github.com/day8/re-frame][re-frame]] to create basic Single-Page Applications.

** What are my goals
1. Practice developing with Emacs
   1. [[https://docs.cider.mx/cider/index.html][Cider]] for tooling, debug, repl
   2. [[https://magit.vc/][Magit]] for version control
   3. [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] for documentation
2. Practice Clojure/script
   1. Learn [[https://leiningen.org/][leiningen]] tooling
3. Develop proficiency with re-frame
   1. Quickly spin up basic SPAs to interact with Clojure applications
   2. Internalize functional approach to building web applications
   3. Compare with developing applications with React/Redux
4. Document the process
   1. So that I don't forget
   2. To maybe organize some sort of tutorial
