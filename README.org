** Notes for development with Emacs
Running from the terminal is trivial with
#+begin_src
lein do dev 
#+end_src


Usually though I want to do everything from Emacs using Cider, so my approach is:
1. cider-jack-in-cljs (C-c M-J)
2. shadow
3. browser-repl
4. Select "y" for "Do you want to open localhost:8240 in a web browser?

This will start the nrepl server, open a repl (in Emacs), open a browser with hot-reload and 
all the works.

I do not recommend using `cider-connect-cljs` as listed in the documentation for shadow-cljs,
since it seems to not open a cider session in emacs (i.e. no code completion for js namespace).
